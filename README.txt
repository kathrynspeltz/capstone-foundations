Minnesota Mountain Biking

Overview
This summer I got back into mountain biking and for my capstone project I wanted to create an easy to use, local application where users could go to find trail/park ideas and customize some of the information for themselves. I was able to achieve this project using Javascript, PosgreSQL, HTML and CSS. Minnesota Mountain Biking has a base database of parks which users can add to, filter and sort, and create their own favorites list. Once a park has been added to a users favorites, they are able to save custom notes to their personal notes section for each park. Users can also remove a park from favorites.

Tech stack
Javascript, PosgreSQL, HTML/CSS, Express/Axios

Features
* Add a park to the database
* Sort/filter the database
* Add a park to favorites
* Remove a park from favorites
* Add personal notes to a favorited park
* Responsive format makes for an easy transition to be mobile-friendly

How to Run 
* Download all capstone project files 
* Add a .env file to add in a postgres key and port key
* Install all needed .json files
* Update the base url code to your server
* Get the application live via nodemon
* Run the seed function to seed the database
